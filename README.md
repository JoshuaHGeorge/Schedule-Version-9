This application is made to help keep track of upcoming assignments.
In the app you can create new assignments and view them.

Input the course and due date for the assignment.
Assignments are displayed on bars, the further down the page they stretch, the closer to their due date they are.
Touch an assignment bar to see how long until they are due.
Assignments that aren't due for 14 or more days, will not stretch down the screen yet.
Assignments that have stretched to the bottom of the screen have red bars to signify that they are past due.
